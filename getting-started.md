# Getting Started

### Requirements

This theme uses SCSS and TypeScript. For that reason, it's necessary to use **Hugo â‰¥ 0.74.0**.

Use Hugo Extended version if you want to:

* Use the latest feature/fix from `master` branch
* Edit SCSS files

**Compiled CSS are updated once per release.**

### Installation

The last release of this theme can be found on this page: [Releases](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack/releases)

If you want to try out the latest feature, you can download the theme executing the next Git clone command on your Hugo site folder.

```text
git clone <https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack/> themes/hugo-theme-stack
```

If it's your first time using this theme, take a look at `exampleSite` folder, which includes a example `config.toml` with all available parameters.

In case this is your first time using Hugo, I recommend you copy the content of `exampleSite` to your Hugo site folder. \(_It includes a set of example posts._\)

The demo site is built using content included in `exampleSite`: [https://theme-stack.jimmycai.com/](https://theme-stack.jimmycai.com/)

Once you've done that, execute `hugo server` in your terminal. You should be able to visualize the theme on `http://localhost:1313`.
