Stack is a simple card-style Hugo theme designed for Bloggers, some of its features are:

* Responsive images support
* Lazy load images
* Dark mode
* [PhotoSwipe](https://photoswipe.com/) integration
* Archive page template
* Full native JavaScript, no jQuery or any other frameworks are used
* No CSS framework, keep it simple and minimal
* External dependencies \(_like PhotoSwipe's library_\) are being loaded selectively, or asynchronously
* Properly cropped thumbnails

The only JavaScript library being used is [node-vibrant](https://github.com/Vibrant-Colors/node-vibrant) for generating colour schemes for articles.
